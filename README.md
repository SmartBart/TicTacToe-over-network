# TicTacToe-over-network

This is a simple TicTacToe game with randomly playing computer, however - you can also play with another player over the network (LAN or, over the Internet if you open port 5555 and NAT on the server computer)! 

(I may also add an option to play againt another human on the same PC) 

This is just an exercise to learn Python, so - don't treat it too seriously, however - if you see any bugs or problems, or if you have any suggestions - please share !
