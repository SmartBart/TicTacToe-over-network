# TicTacToe-over-network

This is a simple TicTacToe game with randomly playing computer, however - you can also play with another player over a network ! 

(I may also add an option to play againt another human on the same PC) 

This is just an exercise to learn Python, so - don't treat it too seriously, however - if you see any bugs or problems, or if you have any suggestions - please share !
